doing1:Implement a function to compute the Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) in a string. Generate code in three rounds:
Base function: Create a recursive solution with memoization.
Test cases: Generate boundary tests (empty string, single character, all identical characters) and complex tests (e.g., "BBABCBCAB").
Optimization: Convert the recursive approach to an iterative DP solution, and analyze time complexity.

doing2:Process a CSV file (data.csv) containing timestamps and numerical values through four steps:
Data loading: Read the CSV, convert the time column to datetime type, and set it as the index.
Resampling: Perform hourly resampling with forward-fill for missing values.
Rolling calculation: Compute a 7-day rolling mean, and flag data points exceeding 3 standard deviations as anomalies.
Visualization: Plot original data, rolling mean, and anomalies using Matplotlib.

doing3:Implement a thread-safe RateLimiter class supporting:
Initialization: Configurable time window (e.g., 60 seconds) and maximum request count (e.g., 100).
Request counting: An allow_request(user_id) method returning boolean permission status.
Data persistence: Add a save_to_redis() method (simulate Redis connection).
Extension: Support dynamic time window adjustments (e.g., automatically expire old data when window changes from 60s to 30s)
